🧑‍💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with practical examples.
The goal is to provide a clear reference for concepts like classes, inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, static members, namespaces, and traits.

Concepts Covered
Class & Object – Creating reusable blueprints and instantiating objects.
Inheritance – Extending functionality from parent classes.
Abstract Classes – Defining contracts with partial implementation.
Interfaces – Enforcing method implementation without code.
Static Members – Using properties/methods without creating objects.
Namespace – Organizing code to avoid conflicts.
Traits – Reusing sets of methods across multiple classes.
